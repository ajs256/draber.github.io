# Spill the beans

You know it there is this word starting with *sp* but you can't quite remember, if the next letter was *y* or an *i*? This little face might know a thing or two that you don't, so watch it while you type! The happy face **🙂** means you are on the right track, the sad face **🙁** shows when you're barking up the wrong tree. This weirdly indifferent look **😐** appears when you didn't type anything yet - or that you completed the word already and there is no other letter to look for.
