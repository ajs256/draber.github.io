# Spill the beans

In Spelling Bee you enter words either by clicking on the cells of the honeycomb (a.k.a hive) or by typing them directly in the field above, which looks like this:


Let's try this out: click on the field below and watch the little face as you type, a good start would be <strong id="random-term"></strong>

<span class="sb-hive-input-content" tabindex="1"></span>

- **🙂** you are doing well
- **🙁** the last letter you typed is wrong, probably because the word is already complete
- **😐** the input filed is empty
