                    <h2>What is this?</h2>
                    <p><strong>Spelling Bee Assistant</strong> is a JavaScript bookmarklet for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee" rel="nofollow">Spelling Bee</a>, the New York Timesâ€™ popular word puzzle.</p>
                    <p>In case you havenâ€™t heard of bookmarklets before, they are small pieces of code that can enhance the functionality of a website. They reside, just like regular bookmarks in your browserâ€™s bookmark menu. </p>
                    <p><img src="img/bookmarklet.png" alt="Bookmarks"></p>
                    <p>This bookmarklet adds three new panels to the game.</p>
                    <div class="panels">
                        <div>
                            <h3>Stats</h3>
                            <img src="img/stats.png" alt="Game stats">
                            <p>The first panel shows some statistics but contains no spoilers. The table will be updated as you progress in the game.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Spoilers</h3>
                            <img src="img/spoilers.png" alt="Spoilers">
                            <p>The second panel is similar to the first one but it gives away information that you probably donâ€™t want to know early on.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <img src="img/solution.png" alt="Solution">
                            <p>The third panel hides a button that - upon confirmation - will solve the game with a few mouse clicks. However, it won't make you Queen Bee ðŸ˜ž. All the words you didn't find yourself will be linked to the respective terms in Google. Maybe this will help you next time!</p>

                    <h2>Does it work everywhere?</h2>
                    <p>The panel is not suitable for the mobile version of the game and has only been tested in the desktop version. It requires a <a href="https://caniuse.com/details">modern browser</a> and wonâ€™t work in Internet Explorer.</p>
                    <h2>Does it not spoil the game?</h2>
                    <p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/crosswords/spellingbee-puzzles.html">this article</a> other people have been creating similar tools, which the Spelling Bee community seems to be fond of.</p>
                    <p>Start the game without the extra panels, then at some point you can display the stats. Do yourself the favor and make a serious effort to solve the game before you click on the magic button. The button is meant to be a last resort, when you eventually run out of ideas and frustration hits.</p>
