# Spelling Bee Assistant

> JavaScript bookmarklet to add functionality to [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee), the New York Times' popular word puzzle.


## What does this thing do?

When you click the bookmarklet it adds two new panels to the game. The first one shows some statistics which are updated as you progress in the game.

The second panel is initially closed for a good reason - it hides a button that will, upon confirmation, solve the game with a few mouse clicks., though it won't make you Queen Bee.

## How do I install it?

Open `index.html` in your web browser and drag and drop the bookmarklet into the bookmark menu.


## Does it work anywhere?

The panel is not suitable for the mobile version of the game and has only been tested on desktop computers. It requires a relatively recent modern browser and won't work on Internet Explorer.


## Is it legal?

At no point the code communicates with the NYT or any other server, everything happens in the browser. It only uses resources that are already available in the source code of the game, i.e. code that has been downloaded by your browser anyway. It's hard to imagine that this could be illegal anywhere but obviously there is no guarantee.


## Does this not spoil the game?

According to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/crosswords/spellingbee-puzzles.html) other people have been doing similar things and the Spelling Bee fans seem to like them. Displaying the stats is fine but you should make a serious effort before you click on the magic button. It's meant to be a last resort, when you eventually run out of ideas.


## How did you do this?

The full source code is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md) at `code/source.js`. The compressed version has been created with [Andrew Chilton's JavaScript Minifier](https://javascript-minifier.com/) and the bookmarklet itself with [Peter Colesâ€™ Bookmarklet Creator](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/).


## I discovered a bug / I would like to have a new feature

Sorry to disappoint you, this was a fun weekend project and chances that it's ever going to be picked up again are slim. You can fork the code, modify it and republish it as long as you respect the license. You can make a PR and I will probably look at it, but I don't wan't this to be a duty.
