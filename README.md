## How did you do this?

You can study the JavaScript source code which is [right here](src/js/source.js). I used the Chrome console for development and some tasks in `nodeJs` to automatize the work as much as possible.


## I discovered a bug / I would like to ask for a new feature

You can report bugs or request features [here](https://github.com/draber/draber.github.io/issues). Keep in mind that this is as a fun weekend project and I don't want it to be a burden. I might work on issues from time to time but I won't make any promises. The code is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md) and you can fork, modify and republish it as long as you respect the terms of the license.
